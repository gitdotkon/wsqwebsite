                                        <p>Hawk Koch is a veteran movie producer, as well as the former President of the Motion
                                            Picture Academy of Arts and Sciences and past President of the Producers Guild of America.</p>

                                        <p>At the Producers' Guild, Koch and his former co-president, Mark Gordon, have led the
                                            fight to preserve the producer's credit and restore its value to working producers.
                                            In 2013, they were able to secure all the major studios and major independents to
                                            agree to uphold the Producer's Mark which unified the industry in a way that further
                                            reinforced the significance of the real producer. Now, only the producers that do the
                                            work and get  "The Producer's Mark" are eligible for the Academy Awards, the Golden
                                            Globes, the Producers Guild Awards and the BAFTA Awards. </p>

                                        <p>Koch's tenure at the Academy included spearheading several initiatives including launching
                                            the first ever general membership meeting, a sharpened focus on member engagement and
                                            the future of filmmaking, as well as major fundraising for the new Academy Museum.</p>

                                        <p>Koch currently serves as a Special Advisor for the Wanda Group, who has commenced the
                                            building of the Movie Metropolis and Wanda Studios in Qingdao, China and is also
                                            consulting on a Qingdao International Film Festival.</p>

                                        <p>Koch has been intimately involved with the making of more than 50 major motion pictures
                                            among them such classics as <span class="italic">Marathon Man, Chinatown, Wayne’s World,
                                    Peggy Sue Got Married, Heaven Can Wait, and Rosemary's Baby.</span></p>

                                        <p>His colleagues and collaborators include many of the greatest filmmakers of
                                            all-time - Sidney Pollack, Roman Polanski, John Schlesinger,
                                            Warren Beatty, and Francis Ford Coppola. In addition to his
