                <div class="content">
                    <p>The full criteria for the Qualifying Qingdao Production Expenditures (QQPE) will be announced and
                        published by November 2016. A general summary of key technical criteria for international and
                        domestic productions are found below. All terms are subject to change without notice.</p>
                    <p>Incentives for Film and TV Productions will involve a generous percentage cash back on qualifying
                        production expenditures incurred in RMB in the Qingdao Oriental Movie Metropolis.</p>
                    <h3>Eligible Productions:</h3>
                    <p>Either a film or television project. The minimum running time of a film project is 60 minutes (or
                        no less than 45 minutes for a large-format like IMAX). The minimum running time of a television
                        project is 30 minutes per episode, inclusive of commercial and public service insertions.</p>
                    <h3>Excluded productions:</h3>
                    <p>Films that are fully or primarily animated, reality programs or game shows, commercials and
                        advertisements, music videos, news and current affairs programs, magazine shows, talk shows,
                        quiz shows, panel shows, variety shows or similar entertainment programs, any program consisting
                        of a competition or contest or the results of a competition or contest, sports and public events
                        coverage, productions with a primary purpose of fun-raising, training or in-house corporate
                        advertising or promotions.</p>
                    <h3>Cultural Test: </h3>
                    <p>To qualify for the International Rebate there is no “cultural test” which a production must pass
                        and no minimum period of time that needs to be spent on shooting or other film-making activities
                        in the Qingdao Region.</p>
                    <h3>Minimum Expenditure:</h3>
                    <p>International films: minimal QQPE equals or exceeds US$15,000,000, and at least 50% of QQPE must
                        be QQPE(OMM) expenditure in the Qingdao Oriental Movie Metropolis.</p>
                    <p>Domestic films: minimal QQPE equals or exceeds RMB¥15,000,000, and at least 50% of QQPE must be
                        QQPE(OMM) expenditure in the Qingdao Oriental Movie Metropolis.</p>
                    <p>International television: minimal QQPE equals or exceeds US$1,000,000 per broadcast slot of one
                        hour, and at least 50% of QQPE must be QQPE(OMM)--expenditure in Qingdao Oriental Movie
                        Metropolis.</p>
                    <p>Domestic television: minimal QQPE equals or exceeds RMB¥1,000,000 per broadcast slot of one hour,
                        and at least 50% of QQPE must be QQPE(OMM)--expenditure in Qingdao Oriental Movie
                        Metropolis.</p>
                    <p>International ATL Cap: The QQPE for Above The Line (ATL) expenditures should be no more than
                        USD$30 million or no more than 30% of total QQPE, whichever is less. </p>
                    <h3>Qualified Expenditures:</h3>
                    <p>‘QQPE’ are non-refundable expenditures incurred by the foreign or domestic producer on production
                        activities in relation to the applicable eligible production, and attributable to goods and
                        services used and consumed in the Qingdao region (including the use of land or properties
                        located in the Qingdao region) and which is not otherwise excluded from QQPE as provided below.
                        The nationality of those providing goods and services has no bearing on whether the expenditure
                        qualifies as QQPE or QQPE (OMM). The “used and consumed” test does not focus on the supplier of
                        goods or services but instead concentrates on the recipient or customer. In order to establish
                        whether an item of expenditure qualifies as QQPE or QQPE (OMM) it is necessary to establish the
                        nature of the specific goods and services in question and the place where the recipient uses or
                        consumes those goods and services.</p>
                    <h3>Qualifying expenditures include:</h3>
                    <p>Accommodation costs (Qingdao region), audit fees (for rebate application purpose only), bank fees
                        (Qingdao region), cast costs (for services in Qingdao; housing expenses included), catering,
                        childcare, closed caption expenditure (prior to completion), company set up costs and expenses,
                        completion guarantee costs and takeover costs (the lesser of (a) 1.5% of QQPE; or (b) 50% of the
                        total fee payable to the completion guarantor), computer-generated imagery expenditure (Qingdao
                        region), contingency, copyright acquisition, crew (for services in Qingdao; housing expenses
                        included), deliverables, equipment, freight, insurance, location hire and other localized

                        expenditures, entertainment expenditures, finance expenditures, goods and services
                        tax/VAT，gratuities, legal fees and expenses, marketing, publicity and promotion expenditures,

                    <p>To qualify for the International Rebate there is no “cultural test” which a production must pass

                        in the Qingdao Region.</p>

                    <p>Domestic television: minimal QQPE equals or exceeds RMB¥1,000,000 per broadcast slot of one hour,
                        and at least 50% of QQPE must be QQPE(OMM)--expenditure in Qingdao Oriental Movie
                        Metropolis.</p>
                    <p>International ATL Cap: The QQPE for Above The Line (ATL) expenditures should be no more than
                        USD$30 million or no more than 30% of total QQPE, whichever is less. </p>
                    <h3>Qualified Expenditures:</h3>
                    <p>‘QQPE’ are non-refundable expenditures incurred by the foreign or domestic producer on production
                        activities in relation to the applicable eligible production, and attributable to goods and
                        services used and consumed in the Qingdao region (including the use of land or properties
                        located in the Qingdao region) and which is not otherwise excluded from QQPE as provided below.
                        The nationality of those providing goods and services has no bearing on whether the expenditure
                        qualifies as QQPE or QQPE (OMM). The “used and consumed” test does not focus on the supplier of
                        goods or services but instead concentrates on the recipient or customer. In order to establish
                        whether an item of expenditure qualifies as QQPE or QQPE (OMM) it is necessary to establish the
                        nature of the specific goods and services in question and the place where the recipient uses or
                        consumes those goods and services.</p>
                    <h3>Qualifying expenditures include:</h3>
                    <p>Accommodation costs (Qingdao region), audit fees (for rebate application purpose only), bank fees
                        (Qingdao region), cast costs (for services in Qingdao; housing expenses included), catering,

                        completion guarantee costs and takeover costs (the lesser of (a) 1.5% of QQPE; or (b) 50% of the
                        total fee payable to the completion guarantor), computer-generated imagery expenditure (Qingdao
                        region), contingency, copyright acquisition, crew (for services in Qingdao; housing expenses
                        included), deliverables, equipment, freight, insurance, location hire and other localized
                        services expenditures, music, overhead, props expenditures, SAFE, SARFT, translation cost,

                        tax/VAT，gratuities, legal fees and expenses, marketing, publicity and promotion expenditures,
